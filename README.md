#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is a branch of engineering associated with developing software products using well-defined scientific principles, procedures, and methods.

## Its importance in the technology industry
It is the backbone of the modern world as it helps shape a better future by addressing challenges in various domains such as enabling remote education, healthcare systems, or improving online security. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**The Birth of Software Engineering**

The term "Software Engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. Software development was recognized as an engineering discipline due to the increasing complexity of software systems and the "software crisis", where projects often exceeded budgets, missed deadlines, or failed. The conference emphasized structured approaches to software development, leading to formalized methodologies.

**The Rise of Software Engineering Practices**

During this period, Object-oriented programming (OOP) gained widespread adoption, revolutionizing software development. Languages like C++ and Java introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism making software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. OOP principles improved collaboration in large teams and led to the development of scalable and efficient systems.

**Modern Software Engineering**

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid document-heavy methodologies like the Waterfall model.
Agile Methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, became widely adopted enabling teams to respond quickly to changing requirements, improve software quality, and deliver products faster through continuous integration and deplopyment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

## Idea Generation
This phase involved gathering and analyzing users's needs and expectations. Developers and stakeholders collaborate to document functional and non-functional requirements.

## Planning
Based on the requirements, the team creates a project roadmap, estimates the costs, allocates resources, and defines a timeline for the development.

## Product design
Involves creating the system architecture and design specifications such as system interface, database design, user interface design, and defining system components to ensure efficient implementation.

## Product development
 This is the implementation phase where developers write codes based on the design documents to build the application

 ## Integration and testing phase
 The developed software is tested to identify and fix bugs. Testing methods such as system testing, integration testing, unit testing, and user acceptance testing are used to ensure the software meets the requirements.

 ## Deployment
 In this phase, the tested software is released for use. This can be done in phases or all at once depending on the project strategy.

 ## Maintenance and Support
 The software requires ongoing maintenance to fix  bugs, improve performance, and update features as user needs evolve.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

## Difference

Waterfall uses the linear and sequential approach while Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach

Waterfall is rigid as changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed while Agile is highly flexible as changes can be made at any stage

Waterfall has fixed phases. This includes requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. With Agile, it's a continuous cycle. 

In waterfall, there is limited customer involvement as they see the product only after completion. In Agile, there is high customer involvement as they provide feedback regularly throughout the development.

In waterfall, testing is carried out after the development is completed while in Agile testing is conducted continuously throughout the development.

In Waterfall, there is a high risk as issues are identified late in the process while in Agile there is a lower risk due to early and continuous feedback

## Scenarios of when to use Waterfall

In construction or engineering software where changes after implementation are costly and impractical

In medical software development where extensive testing and approvals are required before release.

In Large Government or Enterprise projects when regulatory compliance and documentation are critical. An example is in military software and banking system.

## Scenarios of when to use Agile

In Mobile app development where frequent updates and user feedback drive improvement

In Startups and Innovation Projects whereby flexibility and rapid iterations help adapt to market changes.

In E-commerce website development where new features and user experience enhancements are needed regularly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software Developer** - Designs, code, and maintain software applications

Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code

Implement software features based on requirements

Debug and troubleshoot issues in the codebase

Collaborate with designers, QA engineers, and other developers

Optimize application performance and scalability

Maintain documentation for code and system design

**Quality Assurance Engineer** - Ensures the software meets quality standards before release

Develop and execute test plans, cases, and scripts

Identify, document, and report software defects.

Conduct functional, performance, and security checks.

Automate testing processes where applicable

Work closely with developers to ensure issues are resolved

Verify that the final product meets business and user requirements

**Project Manager** - Overseas the software development process to ensure timely and successful project completion

Defines project scope, goals, and deliverables

Develop and manage project timelines and budgets

Allocate resources and assign tasks to team members

Communicate with stakeholders to ensure alignment on project objectives

Identify and mitigate project risks

Ensure the project stays on schedule and within budget

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Keeping up with the rapidly evolving tech industry that requires continuous learning

**Strategies** - Follow industry blogs, attend webinars, and take online courses. Join developers' communities and work on personal projects to practice new Technologies.

Identifying Software bugs which can be time-consuming and frustrating

**Strategies** - Conduct regular code reviews to catch issues early. Use debugging tools like breakpoints and log analyzers. Also, write modular and testable code to make debugging easier.

Managing complex projects that become overwhelming due to scope creep and mismanagement

**Strategies** - Use project management tools like JIRA, Trello, and Asana. Also, break tasks into smaller manageable parts (Agile methodology). Setting clear goals and timelines with stakeholders also helps.

Balancing quality and speed while meeting tight deadlines

**Strategies** - Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent vs important). Communicate delays early and adjust expectations if needed. Use automation tools to speed up repetitive tasks.

Miscommunication within teams can lead to delays and errors

**Strategies** - Hold regular stand-up meetings for progress updates. Use clear documentation and version control (Git). Encourage open communication and feedback within the team.

Security risks and Cyber Threats that can lead to data breaches

**Strategies** - Regularly update software and apply security patches. Perform security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning). Follow secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, encryption)

Balancing work and personal life due to long hours and burnout

**Strategies** - Set boundaries for work hours and take breaks. Use productivity techniques like Pomodoro Techniques (work in focused intervals).  Engage in hobbies and physical activities to reduce stress.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Unit Testing** - Performed by developers to test individual components of the software in isolation to ensure that each unit works correctly. For example, testing a login function to verify it correctly validates user credentials. 

## Importance

Identify bugs early in development

Helps maintain code quality and simplifies debugging

**Integration Testing** - Performed by developers and testers to test interactions between integrated components or systems to ensure they work together as expected. For example, Checking if the payment gateway in an e-commerce website processes transactions correctly when integrated with the checkout module.

## Importance

Detects issues in data flow between modules

Ensures seamless functionality across integrated components

**System Testing** - Performed by QA testers to test the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements. It evaluates the complete application to ensure it works as intended.  For example, testing an entire banking application to ensure transactions, user authentication, and notification work properly.

## Importance

Validates the overall behavior of the system

Helps identify issues before deployment

**Acceptance Testing** - Performed by end users, clients, or QA teams to determine whether the software meets business and user requirements. This ensures that the final product is ready for deployment. For example, a company testing its new HR management system before rolling it out to employees.

## Importance

Confirms the software meets customer expectations

 Reduces risks before full-scale deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt engineering** is the art of crafting statements to get the best response from AI models.

**It saves time and effort** - A well-crafted prompt minimizes back-and-forth interactions, ensuring the AI provides the needed information on the first attempt

**It optimizes AI performance** - This is by providing precise instructions, reducing ambiguity, and avoiding generic answers.

**It improves response quality** - A well-structured prompt guides AI to generate a more accurate, clearer, and contextually relevant response.

**Enables creativity and innovation** - Prompts can be designed to generate unique ideas, creative content, or problem-solving solutions  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Vague Prompt**

Write about AI

**Improved Prompt**

Explain how AI is improving the healthcare industry, including three real-world applications and their benefits.

**Why the improved prompt is more effective**

It is specific and concise eliminating ambiguity thus making it easy for AI to provide the relevant response. It is also clear on AI in healthcare rather than AI in general. All these ensure that the response is informative, well-organized, and aligned with the user's intent.
