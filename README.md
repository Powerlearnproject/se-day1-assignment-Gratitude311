#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is a branch of engineering associated with developing software products using well-defined scientific principles, procedures, and methods.

## Its importance in the technology industry
It is the backbone of the modern world as it helps shape a better future by addressing challenges in various domains such as enabling remote education, healthcare systems, or improving online security. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**The Birth of Software Engineering**

The term "Software Engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. Software development was recognized as an engineering discipline due to the increasing complexity of software systems and the "software crisis", where projects often exceeded budgets, missed deadlines, or failed. The conference emphasized structured approaches to software development, leading to formalized methodologies.

**The Rise of Software Engineering Practices**

During this period, Object-oriented programming (OOP) gained widespread adoption, revolutionizing software development. Languages like C++ and Java introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism making software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. OOP principles improved collaboration in large teams and led to the development of scalable and efficient systems.

**Modern Software Engineering**

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid document-heavy methodologies like the Waterfall model.
Agile Methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, became widely adopted enabling teams to respond quickly to changing requirements, improve software quality, and deliver products faster through continuous integration and deplopyment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

## Idea Generation
This phase involved gathering and analyzing users's needs and expectations. Developers and stakeholders collaborate to document functional and non-functional requirements.

## Planning
Based on the requirements, the team creates a project roadmap, estimates the costs, allocates resources, and defines a timeline for the development.

## Product design
Involves creating the system architecture and design specifications such as system interface, database design, user interface design, and defining system components to ensure efficient implementation.

## Product development
 This is the implementation phase where developers write codes based on the design documents to build the application

 ## Integration and testing phase
 The developed software is tested to identify and fix bugs. Testing methods such as system testing, integration testing, unit testing, and user acceptance testing are used to ensure the software meets the requirements.

 ## Deployment
 In this phase, the tested software is released for use. This can be done in phases or all at once depending on the project strategy.

 ## Maintenance and Support
 The software requires ongoing maintenance to fix  bugs, improve performance, and update features as user needs evolve.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall uses the linear and sequential approach while Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach
Waterfall is rigid as changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed while Agile is highly flexible as changes can be made at any stage
Waterfall has fixed phases. This includes requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. With Agile, it's a continuous cycle. 
In waterfall, there is limited customer involvement as they see the product only after completion. In Agile, there is high customer involvement as they provide feedback regularly throughout the development.
In waterfall, testing is carried out after the development is completed while in Agile testing is conducted continuously throughout the development.
In Waterfall, there is a high risk as issues are identified late in the process while in Agile there is a lower risk due to early and continuous feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt engineering** is the art of crafting statements to get the best response from AI models.

**It saves time and effort** - A well-crafted prompt minimizes back-and-forth interactions, ensuring the AI provides the needed information on the first attempt

**It optimizes AI performance** - This is by providing precise instructions, reducing ambiguity, and avoiding generic answers.

**It improves response quality** - A well-structured prompt guides AI to generate a more accurate, clearer, and contextually relevant response.

**Enables creativity and innovation** - Prompts can be designed to generate unique ideas, creative content, or problem-solving solutions  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Vague Prompt**

Write about AI

**Improved Prompt**

Explain how AI is improving the healthcare industry, including three real-world applications and their benefits.

**Why the improved prompt is more effective**

It is specific and concise eliminating ambiguity thus making it easy for AI to provide the relevant response. It is also clear on AI in healthcare rather than AI in general. All these ensure that the response is informative, well-organized, and aligned with the user's intent.
